	abstract = {The retinotectal projection has long been studied experimentally and theoretically, as a model for the formation of topographic brain maps1,2,3. Neighbouring retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) project their axons to neighbouring positions in the optic tectum, thus re-establishing a continuous neural representation of visual space. Mapping along this axis requires chemorepellent signalling from tectal cells, expressing ephrin-A ligands, to retinal growth cones, expressing EphA receptors4. High concentrations of ephrin A, increasing from anterior to posterior, prevent temporal axons from invading the posterior tectum. However, the force that drives nasal axons to extend past the anterior tectum and terminate in posterior regions remains to be identified. We tested whether axon–axon interactions, such as competition, are required for posterior tectum innervation. By transplanting blastomeres from a wild-type (WT) zebrafish into a lakritz (lak) mutant, which lacks all RGCs5, we created chimaeras with eyes that contained single RGCs. These solitary RGCs often extended axons into the tectum, where they branched to form a terminal arbor. Here we show that the distal tips of these arbors were positioned at retinotopically appropriate positions, ruling out an essential role for competition in innervation of the ephrin-A-rich posterior tectum. However, solitary arbors were larger and more complex than under normal, crowded conditions, owing to a lack of pruning of proximal branches during refinement of the retinotectal projection. We conclude that dense innervation is not required for targeting of retinal axons within the zebrafish tectum but serves to restrict arbor size and shape.},

However, there are fundamental physical constraints on gradient detection, and these strongly limit the fidelity with which axons can respond to gradient cues. I discuss these constraints and argue they suggest that many axon guidance events in vivo cannot be explained solely in terms of gradient-based mechanisms. Rather, precise wiring requires the collaboration of gradients with other types of guidance cues. Since we know relatively little about how this might work, I argue that our understanding of how the brain becomes wired up during development is still at an early stage.},

Recently, members of the Eph and ephrin receptor–ligand family have been found to provide a molecular substrate for one type of mechanism, that of chemospecific gradient matching, as proposed by Sperry. However, experiments over several decades have demonstrated that there is more to map formation than gradient matching. This article briefly reviews the old and new findings, argues that these two types of data must be properly integrated in order to understand map formation fully, and suggests some experimental and theoretical ways to begin this process.},

A paradigm example is the topographic representation of the visual world in the optic tectum/superior colliculus. This map initially forms during neural development using activity-independent molecular cues, most notably some type of chemospecific matching between molecular gradients in the retina and corresponding gradients in the tectum/superior colliculus. Exactly how this process might work has been studied both experimentally and theoretically for several decades. This review discusses the experimental data briefly, and then in more detail the theoretical models proposed. The principal conclusions are that (1) theoretical models have helped clarify several important ideas in the field, (2) earlier models were often more sophisticated than more recent models, and (3) substantial revisions to current modelling approaches are probably required to account for more than isolated subsets of the experimental data.},

	abstract = {Axon guidance by molecular gradients plays a crucial role in wiring up the nervous system. However, the mechanisms axons use to detect gradients are largely unknown. We first develop a Bayesian “ideal observer” analysis of gradient detection by axons, based on the hypothesis that a principal constraint on gradient detection is intrinsic receptor binding noise. Second, from this model, we derive an equation predicting how the degree of response of an axon to a gradient should vary with gradient steepness and absolute concentration. Third, we confirm this prediction quantitatively by performing the first systematic experimental analysis of how axonal response varies with both these quantities. These experiments demonstrate a degree of sensitivity much higher than previously reported for any chemotacting system. Together, these results reveal both the quantitative constraints that must be satisfied for effective axonal guidance and the computational principles that may be used by the underlying signal transduction pathways, and allow predictions for the degree of response of axons to gradients in a wide variety of in vivo and in vitro settings.},

	abstract = {Ephrin-As act as retinal topographic mapping labels, but the molecular basis for two key aspects of mapping remains unclear. First, although mapping is believed to require balanced opposing forces, ephrin-As have been reported to be retinal axon repellents, and the counterbalanced force has not been molecularly identified. Second, although graded responsiveness across the retina is required for smooth mapping, a sharp discontinuity has instead been reported. Here, an axon growth assay was developed to systematically vary both retinal position and ephrin concentration and test responses quantitatively. Responses varied continuously with retinal position, fulfilling the requirement for smooth mapping. Ephrin-A2 inhibited growth at high concentrations but promoted growth at lower concentrations. Moreover, the concentration producing a transition from promotion to inhibition varied topographically with retinal position. These results lead directly to a mapping model where position within a concentration gradient may be specified at the neutral point between growth promotion and inhibition.},

In vitro assays indicate these ephrins are required for repellent activity in the target and also normal responsiveness in the retina. In double homozygotes, anteroposterior order is almost though not completely lost. Temporal or nasal retinal labelings reveal quantitatively similar but opposite shifts, with multiple terminations scattered widely over the target. These results indicate an axon competition mechanism for mapping, with a critical role for ephrins as anteroposterior topographic labels.

We demonstrate here that growth cones of temporal axons collapse when contacting nasal axons in vitro, and removing ephrinAs from axonal membranes by PI-PLC treatment abolishes this response. In conditional knockout mice, temporal axons display no major targeting defects when ephrinA5 is removed only from the SC, but substantial mapping defects were observed when ephrinA5 expression was removed from both the SC and from the retina, with temporal axons invading the target areas of nasal axons. Together, these data indicate that ephrinA5 drives repellent interactions between temporal and nasal axons within the SC, and demonstrates for the ﬁrst time that target-independent mechanisms play an essential role in retinocollicular map formation in vivo.},
