	abstract = {The highly ordered wiring of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neurons in the eye to their synaptic targets in the superior colliculus of the midbrain has long served as the dominant experimental system for the analysis of topographic neural maps1,2,3. Here we describe a quantitative model for the development of one arm of this map—the wiring of the nasal–temporal axis of the retina to the caudal–rostral axis of the superior colliculus. The model is based on RGC–RGC competition that is governed by comparisons of EphA receptor signalling intensity, which are made using ratios of, rather than absolute differences in, EphA signalling between RGCs4. Molecular genetic experiments, exploiting a combinatorial series of EphA receptor knock-in and knockout mice, confirm the salient predictions of the model, and show that it both describes and predicts topographic mapping.},

Focal retinal labeling reveals moderate map abnormalities when either gene is disrupted. Double heterozygotes also have a phenotype, showing an influence of absolute levels. In vitro assays indicate these ephrins are required for repellent activity in the target and also normal responsiveness in the retina. In double homozygotes, anteroposterior order is almost though not completely lost. Temporal or nasal retinal labelings reveal quantitatively similar but opposite shifts, with multiple terminations scattered widely over the target. These results indicate an axon competition mechanism for mapping, with a critical role for ephrins as anteroposterior topographic labels.

We demonstrate here that growth cones of temporal axons collapse when contacting nasal axons in vitro, and removing ephrinAs from axonal membranes by PI-PLC treatment abolishes this response. In conditional knockout mice, temporal axons display no major targeting defects when ephrinA5 is removed only from the SC, but substantial mapping defects were observed when ephrinA5 expression was removed from both the SC and from the retina, with temporal axons invading the target areas of nasal axons. Together, these data indicate that ephrinA5 drives repellent interactions between temporal and nasal axons within the SC, and demonstrates for the ﬁrst time that target-independent mechanisms play an essential role in retinocollicular map formation in vivo.},

First, although mapping is believed to require balanced opposing forces, ephrin-As have been reported to be retinal axon repellents, and the counterbalanced force has not been molecularly identified. Second, although graded responsiveness across the retina is required for smooth mapping, a sharp discontinuity has instead been reported. Here, an axon growth assay was developed to systematically vary both retinal position and ephrin concentration and test responses quantitatively. Responses varied continuously with retinal position, fulfilling the requirement for smooth mapping. Ephrin-A2 inhibited growth at high concentrations but promoted growth at lower concentrations. Moreover, the concentration producing a transition from promotion to inhibition varied topographically with retinal position. These results lead directly to a mapping model where position within a concentration gradient may be specified at the neutral point between growth promotion and inhibition.},

	abstract = {Parcellation of the mammalian cerebral cortex into distinct areas is essential for proper cortical function; however, the developmental program that results in the genesis of distinct areas is not fully understood. We examined the expression of members of the EphA family—the EphA receptor tyrosine kinases and the ephrin-A ligands—within the developing mouse cerebral cortex, with the aim of characterizing this component of the molecular landscape during cortical parcellation. We found that specific embryonic zones, such as the ventricular, subventricular, intermediate, subplate, and marginal zones, as well as the cortical plate, were positive for particular EphA genes early in corticogenesis (E12–E15). Along with this zone-selective expression, several genes (EphA3, EphA4, EphA5) were evenly expressed along the axes of the developing cortex, whereas one family member (EphA7) was expressed in a distinct anteroposterior pattern. Later in corticogenesis (E16–E18), other EphA family members became selectively expressed, but only within the cortical plate: EphA6 was present posteriorly, and ephrin-A5 was expressed within a middle region. At birth, patterning of EphA gene expression was striking. Thus, we found that the expression of a single EphA gene or a combination of family members can define distinct embryonic zones and anteroposterior regions of the neocortex during development. To examine whether cellular context affects the patterning of EphA expression, we examined gene expression in embryonic cortical cells grown in vitro, such that all cellular contacts are lacking, and in Mash-1 mutant mice, in which thalamocortical connections do not form. We found that the expression patterns of most EphA family members remained stable in these scenarios, whereas the pattern of ephrin-A5 was altered. Taken together, this work provides a comprehensive picture of EphA family expression during mouse corticogenesis and demonstrates that most EphA expression profiles are cell intrinsically based, whereas ephrin-A5 is plastically regulated.

The development of connections between thalamic afferents and their cortical target cells occurs in a highly precise manner. Thalamic axons enter the cortex through deep cortical layers, then stop their growth in layer 4 and elaborate terminal arbors specifically within this layer. The mechanisms that underlie target layer recognition for thalamocortical projections are not known. We compared the growth pattern of thalamic explants cultured on membrane substrates purified from cortical layer 4, the main recipient layer for thalamic axons, and cortical layer 5, a non-target layer. Thalamic axons exhibited a reduced growth rate and an increased branching density on their appropriate target membranes compared with non-target substrate. When confronted with alternating stripes of both membrane substrates, thalamic axons grew preferentially on their target membrane stripes. Enzymatic treatment of cortical membranes revealed that growth, branching and guidance of thalamic axons are independently regulated by attractive and repulsive cues differentially expressed in distinct cortical layers. These results indicate that multiple membrane-associated molecules collectively contribute to the laminar targeting of thalamic afferents. Furthermore, we found that interfering with the function of Eph tyrosine kinase receptors and their ligands, ephrins, abolished the preferential branching of thalamic axons on their target membranes, and that recombinant ephrin-A5 ligand elicited a branch-promoting activity on thalamic axons. We conclude that interactions between Eph receptors and ephrins mediate branch formation of thalamic axons and thereby may play a role in the establishment of layer-specific thalamocortical connections.},

	abstract = {A model for the retino-tectal projection is proposed which assumes that axonal growth proceeds predominantly in the direction of maximal slope of a guiding substance (or, more generally, of a system parameter subsuming the effect of several substances). The spatial distribution of this parameter, in turn, results from the interaction of components of retinal axons (which are graded with respect to position of origin in the retina) and tectal components. One or two gradients in each dimension of retina and tectum suffice. Conditions for the generation of a reliable projection on this basis are relatively simple and consistent with conventional enzyme and receptor kinetics. Adhesive forces could but need not be involed in the guiding mechanism. The slope of guiding substances that interfere with an intracellular pattern-forming mechanism within the growth cone may determine the polarity of activation and thus the direction of growth. Generation of primary projections and some features of regulation such as independence of projections on neural pathways, and observations on the innervation of rotated pieces of tectum, can be explained on the basis of the model. The model can be extended by introducing additional production of guiding substance depending on the density, and duration of presence, of fibre terminals in the course of innervation. This simple mechanism would suffice for observed effects of compression and expansion of the map following ablation of retinal and tectal tissue, respectively. It may but need not be involved in the primary projection, too.},

	abstract = {The retinotectal projection has long been studied experimentally and theoretically, as a model for the formation of topographic brain maps1,2,3. Neighbouring retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) project their axons to neighbouring positions in the optic tectum, thus re-establishing a continuous neural representation of visual space. Mapping along this axis requires chemorepellent signalling from tectal cells, expressing ephrin-A ligands, to retinal growth cones, expressing EphA receptors4. High concentrations of ephrin A, increasing from anterior to posterior, prevent temporal axons from invading the posterior tectum. However, the force that drives nasal axons to extend past the anterior tectum and terminate in posterior regions remains to be identified. We tested whether axon–axon interactions, such as competition, are required for posterior tectum innervation. By transplanting blastomeres from a wild-type (WT) zebrafish into a lakritz (lak) mutant, which lacks all RGCs5, we created chimaeras with eyes that contained single RGCs. These solitary RGCs often extended axons into the tectum, where they branched to form a terminal arbor. Here we show that the distal tips of these arbors were positioned at retinotopically appropriate positions, ruling out an essential role for competition in innervation of the ephrin-A-rich posterior tectum. However, solitary arbors were larger and more complex than under normal, crowded conditions, owing to a lack of pruning of proximal branches during refinement of the retinotectal projection. We conclude that dense innervation is not required for targeting of retinal axons within the zebrafish tectum but serves to restrict arbor size and shape.},

Computer simulations based on the model demonstrated desired two-dimensional topographic mapping of the retinal axons on the tectum, and explained three strange behaviors of the retinal axons that had been observed in stripe assays for retinal axons using stripes composed of tectal membrane fragments: repulsive behaviors of the retinal axons by the ligand substances, uncertainty of the nasal axons whether or not they show regional selectivity between substances of anterior and posterior tecta, and abrupt transition of growth of the axons originating at continuously varied retinal positions on the stripes having graded ligand density. Finally we suggested what is to be improved in stripe assays with the artificial gradient of the tectal membrane fragments.},

	abstract = {The complex task of wiring up the brain during embryonic development is achieved by a multitude of guidance signals acting in complex combinations to drive growing axons to their proper targets. The somatosensory system provides an extensively studied model system featuring many universal mechanisms of neural development. In rodents, it constitutes an important model to study how precise topographic connections are achieved. Recent evidence suggests that the Eph/ephrin family of guidance molecules is of pivotal importance for the development of the somatosensory system. Members of Eph/ephrin family are thought to be involved in the global presorting of thalamic axons projecting to the cortex, in labeling speciﬁc cortical areas for innervation, in providing topographic cues within the target area, and in distinguishing cortical layers for intracortical wiring. The Eph/ephrin system also seems to contribute to the formation of speciﬁc corticothalamic feedback projections. So far, the functions of only a few members of the Eph/ephrin family have been examined, but expression analysis indicates complex combinatorial effects of these signaling molecules. Understanding the Eph/ephrin wiring code is expected to yield new insights into the development and plasticity of brain circuits involved in higher functions. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Proper wiring up of the nervous system is critical to the development of organisms capable of complex and adaptable behaviors. Besides the many experimental advances in determining the cellular and molecular machinery that carries out this remarkable task precisely and robustly, theoretical approaches have also proven to be useful tools in analyzing this machinery. A quantitative understanding of these processes can allow us to make predictions, test hypotheses, and appraise established concepts in a new light. Three areas that have been fruitful in this regard are axon guidance, retinotectal mapping, and activity‐dependent development. This chapter reviews some of the contributions made by mathematical modeling in these areas, illustrated by important examples of models in each section. For axon guidance, we discuss models of how growth cones respond to their environment, and how this environment can place constraints on growth cone behavior. Retinotectal mapping looks at computational models for how topography can be generated in populations of neurons based on molecular gradients and other mechanisms such as competition. In activity‐dependent development, we discuss theoretical approaches largely based on Hebbian synaptic plasticity rules, and how they can generate maps in the visual cortex very similar to those seen in vivo. We show how theoretical approaches have substantially contributed to the advancement of developmental neuroscience, and discuss future directions for mathematical modeling in the field.},

We first develop a Bayesian “ideal observer” analysis of gradient detection by axons, based on the hypothesis that a principal constraint on gradient detection is intrinsic receptor binding noise. Second, from this model, we derive an equation predicting how the degree of response of an axon to a gradient should vary with gradient steepness and absolute concentration. Third, we confirm this prediction quantitatively by performing the first systematic experimental analysis of how axonal response varies with both these quantities. These experiments demonstrate a degree of sensitivity much higher than previously reported for any chemotacting system. Together, these results reveal both the quantitative constraints that must be satisfied for effective axonal guidance and the computational principles that may be used by the underlying signal transduction pathways, and allow predictions for the degree of response of axons to gradients in a wide variety of in vivo and in vitro settings.},

Exactly how this process might work has been studied both experimentally and theoretically for several decades. This review discusses the experimental data briefly, and then in more detail the theoretical models proposed. The principal conclusions are that (1) theoretical models have helped clarify several important ideas in the field, (2) earlier models were often more sophisticated than more recent models, and (3) substantial revisions to current modelling approaches are probably required to account for more than isolated subsets of the experimental data.},

In wild-type mice ephrin-A5 is expressed in a gradient in the somatosensory cortex during development. In adult ephrin-A5 knock-out mice, we found a spatial gradient of change in the amount of cortical territory shared by individual whisker functional representations across the somatosensory cortex, as well as a gradient of change in the distance between the functional representations. Both gradients of change were in correspondence with the developmental expression gradient of ephrin-A5 in wild-type mice. These changes involved malformations of the cortical spacing of the thalamocortical components, without concurrent malformations of the intracortical components of individual whisker functional representations. Overall, these results suggest that a developmental guidance label, such as ephrin-A5, is involved in establishing certain spatial relationships of the functional organization of the adult neocortex, and they underscore the advantage of investigating gene manipulation using in vivo functional imaging.},

In the superficial layers of the superior colliculus of the midbrain, converging projections from retinal ganglion cells and neurons in visual cortex must be aligned to form a visuotopic map, but the basic mechanisms mediating this alignment remain elusive. In a new mouse model, ectopic expression of ephrin-A3 (Efna3) in a subset of retinal ganglion cells, quantitatively altering the retinal EFNAs gradient, disrupts cortico-collicular map alignment onto the retino-collicular map, creating a visuotopic mismatch. Genetic inactivation of ectopic EFNA3 restores a wild-type cortico-collicular map. Theoretical analyses using a new mapping algorithm model both map formation and alignment, and recapitulate our experimental observations. The algorithm is based on an initial sensory map, the retino-collicular map, which carries intrinsic topographic information, the retinal EFNAs, to the superior colliculus. These EFNAs subsequently topographically align ingrowing visual cortical axons to the retino-collicular map.},

Here, using the 3-step map alignment computational model, we predict and validate in vivo the visual mapping defects in a well-characterized mouse model. Our results challenge previous hypotheses and provide an alternative, although complementary, explanation for the phenotype observed. In addition, we propose a new quantification method to assess the degree of alignment and organization between maps, allowing inter-model comparisons. This work generalizes the validity and robustness of the 3-step map alignment algorithm as a predictive tool and confirms the basic mechanisms of visual map organization.},

	abstract = {The topographic projection of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons to mouse superior colliculus (SC) or chick optic tectum (OT) is formed in three phases: RGC axons overshoot their termination zone (TZ); they exhibit interstitial branching along the axon that is topographically biased for the correct location of their future TZ; and branches arborize preferentially at the TZ and the initial exuberant projection refines through axon and branch elimination to generate a precise retinotopic map. We present a computational model of map development that demonstrates that the countergradients of EphAs and ephrinAs in retina and the OT/SC and bidirectional repellent signaling between RGC axons and OT/SC cells are sufficient to direct an initial topographic bias in RGC axon branching. Our model also suggests that a proposed repellent action of EphAs/ephrinAs present on RGC branches and arbors added to that of EphAs/ephrinAs expressed by OT/SC cells is required to progressively restrict branching and arborization to topographically correct locations and eliminate axon overshoot. Simulations show that this molecular framework alone can develop considerable topographic order and refinement, including axon elimination, a feature not programmed into the model. Generating a refined map with a condensed TZ as in vivo requires an additional parameter that enhances branch formation along an RGC axon near sites that it has a higher branch density, and resembles an assumed role for patterned neural activity. The same computational model generates the phenotypes reported in ephrinA deficient mice and Isl2-EphA3 knockin mice. This modeling suggests that gradients of counter-repellents can establish a substantial degree of topographic order in the OT/SC, and that repellents present on RGC axon branches and arbors make a substantial contribution to map refinement. However, competitive interactions between RGC axons that enhance the probability of continued local branching are required to generate precise retinotopy. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We address the results of the recent experiment in chick tectum (McLaughlin et al., 2003b) in which axons of retinal ganglion cells were shown to be repelled by high ephrin-B1 density. Thus it was proposed that ephrin-B1 might act as both attractant and repellent. We show that the same axonal behavior may follow from attraction to ephrin-B1 density and axonal competition for space. Therefore, we show how apparent repulsive interaction can be induced by a combination of attraction to the target and competitive interactions between axons. We suggest an experimental test that may distinguish repulsive interaction with the target from repulsion induced by attraction and competition.},

The established map is single-valued, which implies that each point in retina maps to a unique termination zone in superior colliculus. In homozygous Isl2/EphA3 knock-in mice the map is double-valued, which means that each point on retina maps to two termination zones in superior colliculus. This is because about 50 percent of cells in retina express Isl2, and two types of projections, wild-type and Isl2/EphA3 positive, form two branches of the map. In heterozygous Isl2/EphA3 knock-ins the map is intermediate between the homozygous and wild-type: it is single-valued in temporal and double-valued in the nasal parts of retina.

The details of mechanisms involved, and the degree to which they might interact, are still not well understood. We have developed a framework within which existing computational models can be assessed in an unbiased and quantitative manner against a set of experimental data curated from the mouse retinocollicular system. Our framework facilitates comparison between models, testing new models against known phenotypes and simulating new phenotypes in existing models. We have used this framework to assess four representative models that combine Eph/ephrin gradients and/or activity-based mechanisms and competition. Two of the models were updated from their original form to fit into our framework. The models were tested against five different phenotypes: wild type, Isl2-EphA3ki/ki, Isl2-EphA3ki/+, ephrin-A2,A3,A5 triple knock-out (TKO), and Math5−/− (Atoh7). Two models successfully reproduced the extent of the Math5−/− anteromedial projection, but only one of those could account for the collapse point in Isl2-EphA3ki/+. The models needed a weak anteroposterior gradient in the SC to reproduce the residual order in the ephrin-A2,A3,A5 TKO phenotype, suggesting either an incomplete knock-out or the presence of another guidance molecule. Our article demonstrates the importance of testing retinotopic models against as full a range of phenotypes as possible, and we have made available MATLAB software, we wrote to facilitate this process. © 2014 The Authors Developmental Neurobiology Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

I present a novel analysis of abnormal retinocollicular maps in mice in which the distribution of EphA receptors over the retina has been modified by knockin and/or knockout of these receptor types. My analysis shows that in all these cases, whereas the maps themselves are discontinuous, the graded distribution of EphA over the nasotemporal axis of the retina is recreated within the pattern of axonal terminations across rostrocaudal colliculus. This suggests that the guiding principle behind the formation of ordered maps of nerve connections between vertebrate retina and superior colliculus, or optic tectum, is that axons carrying similar amounts of Eph receptor terminate near to one another on the target structure. I show how the previously proposed marker induction model embodies this principle and predicts these results. I then describe a new version of the model in which the properties of the markers, or labels, are based on those of the Eph receptors and their associated ligands, the ephrins. I present new simulation results, showing the development of maps between two-dimensional structures, exploring the role of counter-gradients of labels across the target and confirming that the model reproduces the retinocollicular maps found in EphA knockin/knockout mice. I predict that abnormal distributions of label within the retina lead to abnormal distributions of label over the target, so that in each of the types of knockin/knockout mice analysed, there will be a different distribution of labels over the target structure. This mechanism could be responsible for the flexibility with which neurons reorganise their connections during development and the degree of precision in the final map. Activity-based mechanisms would play a role only at a later stage of development to remove the overlap between individual retinal projection fields, such as in the development of patterns of ocular dominance stripes.},

The retinotectal projection, which topographically maps retinal axons onto the tectum of the midbrain, is an ideal model system with which to investigate the molecular genetics of embryonic brain wiring. Corroborating Sperry's seminal hypothesis, ephrin/Eph counter-gradients on both retina and tectum were found to represent matching chemospecificity markers. Intriguingly, however, it has never been possible to reconstitute topographically appropriate fiber growth in vitro with these cues. Moreover, experimentally derived molecular mechanisms have failed to provide explanations as to why the mapping adapts to grossly diverse targets in some experiments, while displaying strict point-to-point specificity in others. In vitro, ephrin-A/EphA forward, as well as reverse, signaling mediate differential repulsion to retinal fibers, instead of providing topographic guidance. We argue that those responses are indicative of ephrin-A and EphA being members of a guidance system that requires two counteracting cues per axis. Experimentally, we demonstrate by introducing novel double-cue stripe assays that the simultaneous presence of both cues indeed suffices to elicit topographically appropriate guidance. The peculiar mechanism, which uses forward and reverse signaling through a single receptor/ligand combination, entails fiber/fiber interactions. We therefore propose to extend Sperry's model to include ephrin-A/EphA-based fiber/fiber chemospecificity, eventually out-competing fiber/target interactions. By computational simulation, we show that our model is consistent with stripe assay results. More importantly, however, it not only accounts for classical in vivo evidence of point-to-point and adaptive topographic mapping, but also for the map duplication found in retinal EphA knock-in mice. Nonetheless, it is based on a single constraint of topographic growth cone navigation: the balancing of ephrin-A/EphA forward and reverse signaling.},

We apply this method to published visuocollicular mapping data obtained by Fourier-based intrinsic imaging of mouse colliculus. We find that, in maps from wild types and β2 knock-outs, at least 150 points on the colliculus are represented in the visual field in the correct relative order. In maps from animals with knock-out of the three ephrinA ligands (TKO), thought to specify the rostrocaudal axis of the map, the projection on the colliculus of each small circular area of visual field is elongated approximately rostrocaudally. Of these projections, 9\% are made up of two distinct regions lying along the direction of ingrowth of retinal fibers. These are similar to the ectopic projections found in other ephrinA knock-out data. Coexisting with the ectopic projections, each TKO map contains a submap where neighbor–neighbor relations are preserved, which is ordered along both rostrocaudal and mediolateral axes, in the orientation found in wild-type maps. The submaps vary in size with order well above chance level, which can approach the order in wild-type maps. Knock-out of both β2 and two of the three ephrinAs yields maps with some order. The ordered TKO maps cannot be produced by correlated neural activity acting alone, as this mechanism is unable to specify map orientation. These results invite reassessment of the role of molecular signaling, particularly that of ephrinAs, in the formation of ordered nerve connections.},

	abstract = {The topographic projection from the eye to the tectum (amphibians and fish)/superior colliculus (birds and mammals) is a paradigm model system for studying mechanisms of neural wiring development. It has previously been proposed that retinal ganglion cell axons use distinct guidance strategies in fish vs. mammals, with direct guidance to the tectal target zone in the former and overshoot followed by biased branching toward the target zone in the latter. Here we visualized individual retinal ganglion cell axons as they grew over the tectum in zebrafish for periods of 10-21 hours and analyzed these results using an array of quantitative measures. We found that, although axons were generally guided directly toward their targets, this occurred without growth cone turning. Instead, axons branched dynamically and profusely throughout pathfinding, and successive branches oriented growth cone extension toward a target zone in a stepwise manner. These data suggest that the guidance strategies used between fish and mammals may be less distinct than previously thought. J. Comp. Neurol., 521:1409–1429, 2013. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {A paradigm model system for studying the development of patterned connections in the nervous system is the topographic map formed by retinal axons in the optic tectum/superior colliculus. Starting in the 1970s, a series of computational models have been proposed to explain map development in both normal conditions, and perturbed conditions where the retina and/or tectum/superior colliculus are altered. This stands in contrast to more recent models that have often been simpler than older ones, and tend to address more limited data sets, but include more recent genetic manipulations. The original exploration of many of the early models was one-dimensional and limited by the computational resources of the time. This leaves open the ability of these early models to explain both map development in two dimensions, and the genetic manipulation data that have only appeared more recently. In this article, we show that a two-dimensional and updated version of the XBAM model (eXtended Branch Arrow Model), first proposed in 1982, reproduces a range of surgical map manipulations not yet demonstrated by more modern models. A systematic exploration of the parameter space of this model in two dimensions also reveals richer behavior than that apparent from the original one-dimensional versions. Furthermore, we show that including a specific type of axon–axon interaction can account for the map collapse recently observed when particular receptor levels are genetically manipulated in a subset of retinal ganglion cells. Together these results demonstrate that balancing multiple influences on map development seems to be necessary to explain many biological phenomena in retinotectal map formation, and suggest important constraints on the underlying biological variables.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the idea that ordered patterns of nerve connections are set up by means of markers carried by the individual cells. The case of the ordered retinotectal projection in amphibia and fishes is discussed in great detail. It is suggested that retinotectal mappings are the result of two mechanisms acting in concert. One mechanism induces a set of retinal markers into the tectum. By this means, an initially haphazard pattern of synapses is transformed into a continuous or piece-wise continuous projection. The other mechanism places the individual pieces of the map in the correct orientation. The machinery necessary for this inductive scheme has been expressed in terms of a set of differential equations, which have been solved numerically for a number of cases. Straightforward assumptions are made as to how markers are distributed in the retina; how they are induced into the tectum; and how the induced markers bring about alterations in the pattern of synaptic contacts. A detailed physiological interpretation of the model is given. The inductive mechanism has been formulated at the level of the individual synaptic interactions. Therefore, it is possible to specify, in a given situation, not only the nature of the end state of the mapping but also how the mapping develops over time. The role of the modes of growth of retina and tectum in shaping the developing projection becomes clear. Since, on this model, the tectum is initially devoid of markers, there is an important difference between the development and the regeneration of ordered mappings. In the development of duplicate maps from various types of compound-eyes, it is suggested that the tectum, rather than the retina, contains an abnormal distribution of markers. An important parameter in these experiments, and also in the regeneration experiments where part-duplication has been found, is the range of interaction amongst the retinal cells. It is suggested that the results of many of the regeneration experiments (including apparently contradictory ones) are manifestations of a conflict between the two alternative ways of specifying the orientation of the map: through the information carried by the markers previously induced into the tectum and through the orientation mechanism itself.},

	abstract = {We review morphogenesis of the enteric nervous system from migratory neural crest cells, and defects of this process such as Hirschsprung disease, centering on cell motility and assembly, and cell adhesion and extracellular matrix molecules, along with cell proliferation and growth factors. We then review continuum and agent-based (cellular automata) models with rules of cell movement and logistical proliferation. Both movement and proliferation at the individual cell level are modeled with stochastic components from which stereotyped outcomes emerge at the population level. These models reproduced the wave-like colonization of the intestine by enteric neural crest cells, and several new properties emerged, such as colonization by frontal expansion, which were later confirmed biologically. These models predict a surprising level of clonal heterogeneity both in terms of number and distribution of daughter cells. Biologically, migrating cells form stable chains made up of unstable cells, but this is not seen in the initial model. We outline additional rules for cell differentiation into neurons, axon extension, cell-axon and cell–cell adhesions, chemotaxis and repulsion which can reproduce chain migration. After the migration stage, the cells re-arrange as a network of ganglia. Changes in cell adhesion molecules parallel this, and we describe additional rules based on Steinberg's Differential Adhesion Hypothesis, reflecting changing levels of adhesion in neural crest cells and neurons. This was able to reproduce enteric ganglionation in a model. Mouse mutants with disturbances of enteric nervous system morphogenesis are discussed, and these suggest future refinement of the models. The modeling suggests a relatively simple set of cell behavioral rules could account for complex patterns of morphogenesis. The model has allowed the proposal that Hirschsprung disease is mostly an enteric neural crest cell proliferation defect, not a defect of cell migration. In addition, the model suggests an explanations for zonal and skip segment variants of Hirschsprung disease, and also gives a novel stochastic explanation for the observed discordancy of Hirschsprung disease in identical twins.},

	abstract = {A defining characteristic of the normal development of the enteric nervous system (ENS) is the existence of an enteric neural crest (ENC) cell colonization wave, where the ENC cells form stable chains often associated with axons and near the vascular network. However, within this evolving neural network, the individual ENC cell elements constantly move, change direction and appear to act independently of neighbors. Three possible hypotheses are investigated. The simplest of these postulates that the ENS follows the vascular network as a template. We present evidence which does not support this hypothesis. Two viable alternatives are either that (i) the axons muster the ENC cells, providing the pattern for the chain migration or (ii) ENC cells form chains and the axons follow these paths. These two hypotheses are explored by developing a stochastic cellular automata model, where ENC agents follow simple rules, which reflect the underlying biology of movement, proliferation and differentiation. By simulating ENC precursors and the associated neurons and axons, two models with different fundamental mechanisms are developed. From local rules, a mesoscale network pattern with lacunae emerges, which can be analyzed quantitatively. Simulation and analysis establishes the parameters that affect the morphology of the resulting network. This investigation into the axon/ENC and ENC/ENC interplay suggests possible explanations for observations in mouse and avian embryos in normal and abnormal ENS development, as well as further experimentation.},

Although less is known about the intracellular control of axon branching, in recent years significant advances have been made in this area. Kinases and their regulators, Rho GTPases and their regulators, transcription factors, ubiquitin ligases, and several microtubule and actin-binding proteins are now implicated in the control of axon branching.

	abstract = {The relative importance of neural activity versus activity-independent cues in shaping the initial wiring of the brain is still largely an open question. While activity is clearly critical for circuit rearrangements after initial connections have been made, whether it also plays a role in initial axon pathfinding remains to be determined. Here, we investigated this question using the guidance of zebrafish retinal ganglion cell axons to their targets in the tectum as a model. Recent results have implicated biased branching as a key feature of pathfinding in the zebrafish tectum. Using tetrodotoxin to silence neural activity globally, we found a decrease in the area covered by axon branches during pathfinding. After reaching the target, there were dynamic differences in axon length, area and the number of branches between conditions. However, other aspects of pathfinding were unaffected by silencing, including the ratio of branches directed toward the target, length, and number of branches, as well as turning angle, velocity, and number of growth cones per axon. These results challenge the hypothesis that neural connections develop in sequential stages of molecularly guided pathfinding and activity-based refinement. Despite a maintenance of overall guidance, axon pathfinding dynamics can nevertheless be altered by activity loss. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Develop Neurobiol 75: 608–620, 2015},

Temporal retinal axons extending across alternating membranes from the topographically correct rostral SC or the incorrect caudal SC of embryonic rats preferentially branch on rostral membranes. Branching preference is due to an inhibitory phosphatidylinositol-linked molecule in the caudal SC.

	abstract = {The retinotectal projection is the predominant model for studying molecular mechanisms controlling development of topographic axonal connections. Our analyses of topographic mapping of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons in chick optic tectum indicate that a primary role for guidance molecules is to regulate topographic branching along RGC axons, a process that imposes unique requirements on the molecular control of map development. We show that topographically appropriate connections are established exclusively by branches that form along the axon shaft. Initially, RGC axons overshoot their appropriate termination zone (TZ) along the anterior–posterior (A-P) tectal axis; temporal axons overshoot the greatest distance and nasal axons the least, which correlates with the nonlinear increasing A-P gradient of ephrin-A repellents. In contrast, branches form along the shaft of RGC axons with substantial A-P topographic specificity. Topography is enhanced through the preferential arborization of appropriately positioned branches and elimination of ectopic branches. Using a membrane stripe assay and time-lapse microscopy, we show that branches form de novo along retinal axons. Temporal axons preferentially branch on their topographically appropriate anterior tectal membranes. After the addition of soluble EphA3-Fc, which blocks ephrin-A function, temporal axons branch equally on anterior and posterior tectal membranes, indicating that the level of ephrin-As in posterior tectum is sufficient to inhibit temporal axon branching and generate branching specificity in vitro. Our findings indicate that topographic branch formation and arborization along RGC axons are critical events in retinotectal mapping. Ephrin-As inhibit branching along RGC axons posterior to their correct TZ, but alone cannot account for topographic branching and must cooperate with other molecular activities to generate appropriate mapping along the A-P tectal axis.},

	abstract = {We report that EphB receptors direct unique axonal behaviors required for mapping the dorsal-ventral (D-V) retinal axis along the lateral-medial (L-M) axis of the superior colliculus (SC). EphBs are expressed in a D-V gradient, ephrin-B1 in a L-M gradient in SC, and ephrin-B3 at its midline. EphBs and ephrin-Bs are expressed in countergradients in retina and SC. Developmental analyses reveal that retinal axons lack D-V ordering along the L-M axis, but directionally extend branches along it to establish ordered arbors. Directed branch extension is disrupted in EphB2; EphB3-deficient mice resulting in lateral ectopic arbors. Mice with kinase-inactive EphB2 have similar D-V mapping defects indicating that forward signaling dominates over reverse signaling. Our data suggest that branches of EphB expressing axons are attracted medially by ephrin-B1, and provide molecular mechanisms for D-V mapping in visual centers.},

	abstract = {Molecular gradients have been postulated to control the topographic mapping of retinal axons in their central targets. Based initially on their expression patterns, and more recently on functional studies, members of the EphA subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin-A ligands have been implicated in the guidance of retinal axons along the anterior–posterior axis of the chick optic tectum. The report that a receptor of the EphB subfamily, EphB2/Cek5/Nuk/Sek3, is expressed in a high ventral to low dorsal gradient in the developing chick retina and is present on ganglion cell axons suggests that it may be involved in the mapping of retinal axons along the corresponding dorsal–ventral axis of the tectum. To address this issue, we have determined the expression and distribution of ephrin-B1/LERK-2/Cek5-L and ephrin-B2/LERK-5/Htk-L/ELF-2, ligands for EphB2, in the developing chick retinotectal system using riboprobes, immunocytochemistry, and receptor affinity probes. Both ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 transcripts are expressed in a high dorsal to low ventral gradient in the developing retina, complementary to the distribution of EphB2. Ephrin-B1 and ephrin-B2 proteins are predominantly found in the developing plexiform layers, suggesting a role in the development of intraretinal connections. Neither protein is detected on ganglion cell axons. In tectum, ephrin-B1 transcripts are expressed in a high dorsal to low ventral gradient in the neuroepithelium and the protein is present along the processes of radial glia and is concentrated at their endfeet in the stratum opticum, at the time retinal axons are growing through it. This distribution of ephrin-B1 suggests that it influences retinal axon mapping along the dorsal–ventral tectal axis and may also be involved in intratectal development. In contrast, ephrin-B2 transcripts and protein are localized to the deeper retinorecipient laminae in the tectum at the time retinal axons begin to arborize in them, suggesting that this ligand may influence the laminar patterning of retinal axon terminations.},

The paradigm for such maps is the precisely ordered wiring of the output cells of the eye to their synaptic targets in the tectum of the midbrain. The retinotectal map is organized in development through the graded activity of Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin ligands. These signaling proteins are arrayed in complementary expression gradients along the orthogonal axes of the retina and tectum, and provide both input and recipient cells with Cartesian coordinates that specify their location. Molecular genetic studies in the mouse indicate that these coordinates are interpreted in the context of neuronal competition for termination sites in the tectum. They further suggest that order in the retinotectal map is determined by ratiometric rather than absolute difference comparisons in Eph signaling along the temporal-nasal and dorsal-ventral axes of the eye.},

These properties implicate ephrin-A5 in the formation of topographic maps, a fundamental organizational feature of the nervous system. To test this hypothesis, we generated mice lacking ephrin-A5. The majority of ephrin-A5−/− mice develop to adulthood, are morphologically intact, and have normal anterior–posterior patterning of the midbrain. However, within the SC, retinal axons establish and maintain dense arborizations at topographically incorrect sites that correlate with locations of low expression of the related ligand ephrin-A2. In addition, retinal axons transiently overshoot the SC and extend aberrantly into the inferior colliculus (IC). This defect is consistent with the high level of ephrin-A5 expression in the IC and the finding that retinal axon growth on membranes from wild-type IC is inhibited relative to that on membranes from ephrin-A5−/− IC. These findings show that ephrin-A5 is required for the proper guidance and mapping of retinal axons in the mammalian midbrain.},

Here, using the 3-step map alignment computational model, we predict and validate in vivo the visual mapping defects in a well-characterized mouse model. Our results challenge previous hypotheses and provide an alternative, although complementary, explanation for the phenotype observed. In addition, we propose a new quantification method to assess the degree of alignment and organization between maps, allowing inter-model comparisons.

	abstract = {Navigating axons respond to environmental guidance signals, but can also follow axons that have gone before - pioneer axons. Pioneers have been studied extensively in simple systems, but the role of axon-axon interactions remains largely unexplored in large vertebrate axon tracts, where cohorts of identical axons could potentially use isotypic interactions to guide each other through multiple choice points. Furthermore, the relative importance of axon-axon interactions compared with axon-autonomous receptor function has not been assessed. Here, we test the role of axon-axon interactions in retinotectal development, by devising a technique to selectively remove or replace early-born retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). We find that early RGCs are both necessary and sufficient for later axons to exit the eye. Furthermore,introducing misrouted axons by transplantation reveals that guidance from eye to tectum relies heavily on interactions between axons, including both pioneer-follower and community effects. We conclude that axon-axon interactions and ligand-receptor signaling have co-equal roles, cooperating to ensure the fidelity of axon guidance in developing vertebrate tracts.},

	abstract = {The retinotectal projection in larval goldfish was studied with the aid of anterograde filling of optic fibers with HRP applied to the retina. The results show that optic fibers have already reached the tectum and begun to form terminal arbors in newly hatched fish. The projection is topographic in that fibers from local regions of the retina project to discrete patches of tectum, with the smallest patch covering 3.5\% of the total surface area of tectal neuropil. Many fibers in young larvae have numerous short side branches along their length and only some of them show evidence of terminal sprouting. The arbors are approximately elliptical in shape and average about 1,500 μ;m2. Growth cones are seen frequently. In older Iarvae, terminal arbors are larger and more highly branched, and they have begun to resemble those in adult fish. Fibers terminate in two strata; those in the upper layer are smaller (1,800 μ;m2 on average) than those in the deeper stratum (4,000 μ;m2 on average). The fraction of tectal surface area covered by individual arbors (the “tectal coverage”) ranges from 1.5\% to 3\% of the total surface area of the tectal neuropil. In contrast, the tectal coverage of individual arbors in young adult goldfish is much smaller, ranging from 0.02\% to 0.42\% of tectal surface area (Stuermer, '84, and unpublished). This apparent increase in precision of the map in older animals is not due to retraction of arbors, which are slightly larger in adults, but is accounted for by overall tectal growth: the tectal neuropil in goldfish increases in area by about 250-fold during this period (Raymond, '86).},

The anterogradely labeled axons were visualized in tectal whole mounts. Axons traveled through all regions of the tectum in various abnormal routes. Misrouted axons were also seen to alter their orientation and to direct their course toward their target. At all regeneration stages the majority of dorsotemporal axons coursed and achieved target-related orientations preferentially within the rostral tectal half whereas dorsonasal axons proceeded into the caudal tectum. The growing axons exhibited various morphologies. All axons in the superficial fascicle layer stratum opticum (SO) and some in the synaptic layer stratum fibrosum et griseum superficiale (SFGS) were unbranched and tipped with a leading growth cone. Other axons in the synaptic layer carried one to several growth cones at their ends and often filopodia proximal to the growth cone, or they had sprouted numerous side branches with growth cones and filopodia on the shaft and on branches. Some axons at retinotopic or ectopic sites gave rise to several long branches of several hundred microns in length, with growth cones and filopodia. From 32 days onward axons ending in terminal arbors at retinotopic sites became apparent. Thus, numerous axons at early regeneration stages go through a phase of exploratory growth on their way toward their target sites.},

During optic nerve regeneration, expression throughout the tectum is increased by 1 month as a strong rostrocaudal gradient. The gradient declines to normal by 3 months.

We recently cloned ELF-1 as a ligand for Eph family receptors. Here, RNA hybridization shows matching expression gradients for ELF-1 in the tectum and its receptor Mek4 in the retina. Binding activity detected with alkaline phosphatase fusions of ELF-1 and Mek4 also reveals gradients and provides direct evidence for molecular complementarity of gradients in reciprocal fields.

Ephrin-family proteins are required for both anterior–posterior and medial–lateral topographic mapping, but the opposing forces have not been well characterized. Wnt-family proteins are recently discovered axon guidance cues. We find that Wnt3 is expressed in a medial–lateral decreasing gradient in chick optic tectum and mouse superior colliculus. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons from different dorsal–ventral positions showed graded and biphasic response to Wnt3 in a concentration-dependent manner. Wnt3 repulsion is mediated by Ryk, expressed in a ventral-to-dorsal decreasing gradient, whereas attraction of dorsal axons at lower Wnt3 concentrations is mediated by Frizzled(s). Overexpression of Wnt3 in the lateral tectum repelled the termination zones of dorsal RGC axons in vivo. Expression of a dominant-negative Ryk in dorsal RGC axons caused a medial shift of the termination zones, promoting medially directed interstitial branches and eliminating laterally directed branches. Therefore, a classical morphogen, Wnt3, acting as an axon guidance molecule, plays a role in retinotectal mapping along the medial–lateral axis, counterbalancing the medial-directed EphrinB1–EphB activity.},

	abstract = {Engrailed-2 (En-2), a homeodomain transcription factor, is expressed in a caudal-to-rostral gradient in the developing midbrain, where it has an instructive role in patterning the optic tectum—the target of topographic retinal input1,2. In addition to its well-known role in regulating gene expression through its DNA-binding domain, En-2 may also have a role in cell–cell communication, as suggested by the presence of other domains involved in nuclear export, secretion and internalization3. Consistent with this possibility, here we report that an external gradient of En-2 protein strongly repels growth cones of Xenopus axons originating from the temporal retina and, conversely, attracts nasal axons. Fluorescently tagged En-2 accumulates inside growth cones within minutes of exposure, and a mutant form of the protein that cannot enter cells fails to elicit axon turning. Once internalized, En-2 stimulates the rapid phosphorylation of proteins involved in translation initiation and triggers the local synthesis of new proteins. Furthermore, the turning responses of both nasal and temporal growth cones in the presence of En-2 are blocked by inhibitors of protein synthesis. The differential guidance of nasal and temporal axons reported here suggests that En-2 may participate directly in topographic map formation in the vertebrate visual system.},

We have purified and cloned a GPI-anchored, 25 kDa glycoprotein that is a good candidate for a molecule involved in this process. During the time of innervation by retinal ganglion cells, this protein is gradedly expressed in the posterior part of the developing tectum. In two different in vitro assay systems, the recombinant protein induces growth cone collapse and repulsion of retinal ganglion cell axons. These phenomena are observed for axons of temporal as well as nasal origin, indicating that an additional activity may be necessary to confer the nasotemporal specificity observed in previous assays. We named the protein RAGS (for repulsive axon guidance signal). The sequence of RAGS shows significant homology to recently identified ligands for receptor tyrosine kinases of the Eph subfamily.},

The dominant model to study the development of topographic maps is the projection from the retinal ganglion cells to the optic tectum/colliculus. The expression pattern of Eph/ephrin system in opposing gradients both in the retina and the tectum, labels the local addresses on the target and gives specific sensitivities to growth cones according to their topographic origin in the retina. The rigid precision of normal retinotopic mapping has prompted the chemoaffinity hypothesis, positing axonal targeting to be based on fixed biochemical affinities between fibers and targets. However, several lines of evidence have shown that the mapping can adjust to experimentally modified targets with flexibility, demonstrating the robustness of the guidance process. Here we discuss the complex ways the Ephs and ephrins interact allowing to understand how the retinotectal mapping is a precise but also a flexible process.},

	abstract = {Neural circuits are wired by chemotactic migration of growth cones guided by extracellular guidance cue gradients. How growth cone chemotaxis builds the macroscopic structure of the neural circuit is a fundamental question in neuroscience. I addressed this issue in the case of the ordered axonal projections called topographic maps in the retinotectal system. In the retina and tectum, the erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular (Eph) receptors and their ligands, the ephrins, are expressed in gradients. According to Sperry’s chemoaffinity theory, gradients in both the source and target areas enable projecting axons to recognize their proper terminals, but how axons chemotactically decode their destinations is largely unknown. To identify the chemotactic mechanism of topographic mapping, I developed a mathematical model of intracellular signaling in the growth cone that focuses on the growth cone’s unique chemotactic property of being attracted or repelled by the same guidance cues in different biological situations. The model presented mechanism by which the retinal growth cone reaches the correct terminal zone in the tectum through alternating chemotactic response between attraction and repulsion around a preferred concentration. The model also provided a unified understanding of the contrasting relationships between receptor expression levels and preferred ligand concentrations in EphA/ephrinA- and EphB/ephrinB-encoded topographic mappings. Thus, this study redefines the chemoaffinity theory in chemotactic terms.},

The formation of TZs is initiated by interstitial branching at topographically appropriate positions. Ephrin-As are expressed in a decreasing posterior-to-anterior gradient in the SC, and they suppress branching posterior to future TZs. Here we investigate the role of an EphA7 gradient in the SC, which has the reverse orientation to the ephrin-A gradient. We find that in EphA7 mutant mice the retinocollicular map is disrupted, with nasal and temporal axons forming additional or extended TZs, respectively. In vitro, retinal axons are repelled from growing on EphA7-containing stripes. Our data support the idea that EphA7 is involved in suppressing branching anterior to future TZs. These findings suggest that opposing ephrin-A and EphA gradients are required for the proper development of the retinocollicular projection.},

	abstract = {The distribution of normal and regenerating retinal fibers and synapses was studied on tectum in goldfish by light (LM) and electron microscopy (EM). Since labeling of the early regenerating fibers was previously reported to be difficult, a new “cold-fill” HRP labeling protocol was developed, which labeled regenerating optic fibers and terminals on tectum as early as 14 days after nerve crush when they first arrive on tectum. In order to characterize the laminar distribution of optic afferents in normal fish and in fish regenerating for 14–240 days, EM photomontages of areas 14 μm wide by 160 μm deep through the HRP-labeled primary optic innervation layer (S-SO-SFGS) were constructed. The time points in regeneration that were examined spanned the period in which others have shown that an initially diffuse retinotopic map becomes spatially restricted. At the LM level regenerating optic fibers were restricted to the optic lamina. They reinnervated tectum in an anterior to posterior sequence as previously seen with autoradiography. In addition, at 14 days, some “pioneer” optic fascicles were found to have already grown to posterior tectum where they gave rise to branches with boutonlike terminations and growth-cone-like processes. From the ultrastructural analysis it was clear that optic fibers and terminals observed strict laminar boundaries as they partitioned themselves in the optic laminae (S, SO and SFGS) in both normal and regenerating fish. The behavior of optic fibers was lamina specific with respect to synapse formation and the orientation of fiber outgrowth. As early as 14 days regeneration, optic fibers made synapses onto the four types of postsynaptic profiles observed in normal fish. Numerous optic terminals were labeled at 14 days, and there appeared to be no waiting period between fiber ingrowth to the SO and synapse formation in the S and SFGS. At 14–60 days, atypical synaptic contacts which appear to be nascent synapses were made by labeled optic fibers in fascicles and by growth-cone-like processes. By 21–30 days, the density of optic terminals was high and there were many more fasciculated optic fibers in the SFGS than normal as late as 240 days. These findings suggest that optic fiber lamination is highly constrained by tectal cues, that fibers rapidly regenerate many synaptic terminals before retinotopic map refinement is complete, and that fibers have a strong affinity for each other.},

Young axons express the E587 antigen, a member of the L1 family of cell adhesion molecules. Repeated injections of Fab fragments from a polyclonal E587 antiserum (E587 Fabs) into the eye of 3.4 cm goldfish disrupted the orderly fascicle pattern of RGC axons in the retina which was preserved in controls. Instead of bundling tightly, RGC axons crossed one another, grew between fascicles and arrived at the optic disk in a broadened front. When added to RGC axons growing in vitro, E587 Fabs neutralized the preference of growth cones to elongate on lanes of E587 protein, caused defasciculation of axons which normally prefer to grow along each other when explanted on polylysine, and prevented clustering of E587 antigen at axon-axon contact sites. Monoclonal E587 antibody disturbed axonal fasciculation moderately but led to a 30\% reduction in growth velocities when axons tracked other axons. Therefore we conclude that E587 antigen mediates axonal recognition, selective fasciculation and the creation of the age-related order in the fish retina.},

Expression of interacting Ephs and ephrins typically occurs in complementary regions, such that polarised activation of both components occurs at the interface. Forward signaling through Eph receptors can drive cell segregation, but it is unclear whether reverse signaling through ephrins can also contribute. We have tested the role of reverse signaling, and of polarised versus non-polarised activation, in assays in which contact repulsion drives cell segregation and border sharpening. We find that polarised forward signaling drives stronger segregation than polarised reverse signaling. Nevertheless, reverse signaling contributes since bidirectional Eph and ephrin activation drives stronger segregation than unidirectional forward signaling alone. In contrast, non-polarised Eph activation drives little segregation. We propose that although polarised forward signaling is the principal driver of segregation, reverse signaling enables bidirectional repulsion which prevents mingling of each population into the other.},

In vitro stripe assays show that dorsal retinal axons prefer to grow on EphB receptor stripes supporting an attractive guidance mechanism. In vivo disruption of EphB/ephrin-B function by application of exogenous EphB or expression of dominant-negative ephrin-B ligand in dorsal retinal axons causes these axons to shift dorsally in the tectum, while misexpression of wild-type ephrin-B in ventral axons causes them to shift ventrally. These dorsoventral targeting errors are consistent with the hypothesis that an attractive mechanism that requires ephrin-B cytoplasmic domain is critical for retinotectal mapping in this axis.},

A subset of retinal axons, those from the temporal half, is guided by repulsive cues expressed in a graded fashion in the optic tectum2,3, part of the midbrain. Here we report the cloning and functional characterization of a membrane-associated glycoprotein, which we call RGM (repulsive guidance molecule). This molecule shares no sequence homology with known guidance cues, and its messenger RNA is distributed in a gradient with increasing concentration from the anterior to posterior pole of the embryonic tectum. Recombinant RGM at low nanomolar concentration induces collapse of temporal but not of nasal growth cones and guides temporal retinal axons in vitro, demonstrating its repulsive and axon-specific guiding activity.},

In contrast to ephrins, semaphorins, netrins and slits3,4, no receptor mechanism for RGM action has been defined. Here, an expression cloning strategy identified neogenin as a binding site for RGM, with a sub-nanomolar affinity. Consistent with selective axonal responsiveness to RGM, neogenin is expressed in a gradient across the chick retina. Neogenin is known to be one of several netrin-binding proteins5 but only neogenin interacts with RGM. The avoidance of RGM by temporal retinal axons is blocked by the anti-neogenin antibody and the soluble neogenin ectodomain. Dorsal root ganglion axons are unresponsive to RGM but are converted to a responsive state by neogenin expression. Thus, neogenin functions as an RGM receptor.},

	abstract = {Although molecular gradients have long been postulated to play a role in the development of topographic projections in the nervous system, relatively little is known about how axons evaluate gradients. Do growth cones respond to concentration or to slope? Do they react suddenly or gradually? Is there adaptation? In the developing retinotectal system, temporal retinal ganglion cell axons have previously been shown to avoid repellent cell-surface activities distributed in gradients across the optic tectum. We confronted temporal retinal axons with precisely formed striped linear gradients of repellent tectal membranes and of two candidate repellent molecules, ephrin-A2 and -A5. Axons entered gradient stripes independently of their slope and extended unhindered in the uphill direction until they suddenly avoided an apparent threshold concentration of repellent material that was independent of slope. This critical concentration was similar in both linear and nonlinear gradients, and hence independent of gradient shape. When gradients of identical slope were formed on different basal levels of repellent material, axons grew uphill for a fixed increment of concentration, possibly measured from the lowest point of the gradient, rather than up to a fixed absolute concentration. The speed of growth cones was not affected by repellent unstriped gradients below the critical concentration level. Similar results were found with membranes from cell lines stably transfected with either ephrin-A5 or ephrin-A2, two previously identified growth cone repellent cell-surface proteins. These data suggest that growth cones or axons can integrate guidance information over large distances, probably by a combined memory and adaptation mechanism. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Because the original text was written in German yet is often quoted by English-speaking authors, we undertook a complete translation of the 1913 publication, which we provide as Supporting Information. Here we introduce the translation, describe the historical context of the work, and show a new analysis of the original data. In doing so, we uncovered several surprises that reveal an interesting glimpse into the early history of enzymology. In particular, our reanalysis of Michaelis and Menten’s data using modern computational methods revealed an unanticipated rigor and precision in the original publication and uncovered a sophisticated, comprehensive analysis that has been overlooked in the century since their work was published. Michaelis and Menten not only analyzed initial velocity measurements but also fit their full time course data to the integrated form of the rate equations, including product inhibition, and derived a single global constant to represent all of their data. That constant was not the Michaelis constant, but rather Vmax/Km, the specificity constant times the enzyme concentration (kcat/Km × E0).},

Here, we show that EphA receptors colocalize on retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons with EphA ligands, which are expressed in a high-nasal-to-low-temporal pattern. In the stripe assay, only temporal axons are normally sensitive for repellent axon guidance cues of the caudal tectum. However, overexpression of ephrinA ligands on temporal axons abolishes this sensitivity, whereas treatment with PI-PLC both removes ephrinA ligands from retinal axons and induces a striped outgrowth of formerly insensitive nasal axons. In vivo, retinal overexpression of ephrinA2 leads to topographic targeting errors of temporal axons. These data suggest that differential ligand expression on retinal axons is a major determinant of topographic targeting in the retinotectal projection.},

In vivo, when the tectal ELF-1 pattern is modified by retroviral overexpression, retinal axons avoid ectopic ELF-1 patches and map to abnormally anterior positions.

At later stages of development L3 is expressed in a graded fashion throughout the tectum and L4 is maintained at its posterior margin. Growth cone collapse and pathway selection assays demonstrate that both these proteins have a collapse activity for retinal ganglion cells. When faced with a choice of substrate on which to grow, temporal axons from chick retinal ganglion cells selectively avoided membranes from Cos cells transfected with L3, whereas nasal axons did not. Both temporal and nasal axons avoided membranes from Cos cells transfected with L4. The expression patterns together with the functional data suggest that although both ligands may be able to guide retinal ganglion cells axons in vitro, they have different roles in the guidance of retinotectal projections in vivo. The expression of L3 is consistent with a role in the guidance of retinal ganglion cells to their targets on the tectum whereas that of L4 suggests a role in delineating the posterior boundary of the optic tectum.},

	abstract = {There exist in certain nervous systems topological mappings of one set of spatially ordered nerve cells onto another, whose formation has not yet been satisfactorily explained. In this paper the role that competition may play in the development of such spatially patterned nervous connexions is discussed, and simple models incorporating competition and graded affinity between axons and postsynaptic sites have been tested by computer simulation. It is shown that the conditions for map making by this mechanism are that there is not only competition between axons for postsynaptic sites but also between postsynaptic sites for axons; and that this can be effected by imposing saturation conditions limiting the number of postsynaptic sites an axon may contact simultaneously and similarly the number of axon branches that can contact a postsynaptic cell. The possibility was investigated that competition models might lead to spreading or compression of the pattern of connexions in spatial mismatch experiments, such as have been done on the visual system of lower vertebrates. Two classes of these experiments exist: (a) those in which no size disparity is present between the set of presynaptic branches and the set of postsynaptic sites (for example, Xenopus the compound eye experiments); competition models predict an obligatory spreading of connexions without postulating regulation; (b) those in which a size disparity does exist (for example, a complete retina being made to regenerate into a half tectum, or vice versa); competition models predict spreading-compression only if the number of possible presynaptic branches available for contact formation is once more made equal to the number of available sites. The interpretation of other experimental designs is discussed. The importance of the establishment of transient or temporary contacts during development is emphasized.},

If a piece of tissue is rotated by 180Â°, the neural structures resulting from it are correspondingly reversed. Despite such determination of the anatomical polarity, the polarity for selective nerve connections remains labile. When a part or the whole of the tectum is reversed, the trajectory of the optic nerve is sometimes altered, but the array of optic axons invading the tectum ignores the anatomical reversal of the target structure and forms a normal retino-tectal projection with respect to the whole animal. Whenever the position of the diencephalon relative to the tectum is altered, however, the axial polarity of the retino-tectal projection is altered correspondingly.},

From normal eyes, nasal fibres were widespread in the optic tract and mostly entered the tectum through the medial and lateral brachia. Ventral retinal fibres approached the tectum via the medial brachium and dorsal retinal fibres passed through the lateral brachium, while temporal retinal fibres formed a narrow band in the centre of the tract and entered the tectum directly at its rostral border. Fibres from NN eyes formed a wide tract and strong medial and lateral brachia.Fibres from VV eyes all entered the tectum via the medial brachium and fibres from TT eyes formed a narrow tract and entered the tectum directly from its rostral extremity. Thus fibres from each type of compound eye followed pathways to the tectum that were appropriate to the embryonic origin of the retina forming the compound eye.},

	abstract = {The time-course and general features of optic nerve regeneration in goldfish were followed in sections prepared at spaced intervals between 3 and 67 days after nerve section. Differential route and destination preferences of fibers from different parts of the retina were then tested by removing specific portions of the retina in combination with complete section of the optic nerve. With the dorsal half of the retina destroyed, surviving ventral fibers became segregated beyond the nerve scar and selectively entered the medial tract to connect with dorsal tectum. Conversely, when dorsal retina remained intact, the regenerating fibers filled selectively the lateral tract and the ventral tectum. Fibers from the posterior (temporal) hemiretina invaded the anterior portion of the tectum and did not extend into the posterior regions. Conversely, those from the anterior hemiretina bypassed the anterior zones to innervate the posterior tectum. Fibers from the center of the retina, after reaching the parallel layer within the tectum, bypassed the plexiform layer in the margin to connect only in the central zone. The plexiform layer in the marginal zones was innervated only when fibers were available from the peripheral retina. The results furnish direct microscopical evidence for the orderly selective termination of optic fibers in the brain centers. They also demonstrate a remarkable and unexpected (presumably chemotactic) selectivity in the tendency of different retinal fiber groups to choose and to follow specific central pathways en route to their synaptic destinations. The thesis that specific chemical affinities govern the formation and maintenance of neuronal associations is extended on the basis of the present results to include the patterning of central fiber pathways.},

	abstract = {The topographical retino-tectal projection of goldfish was electrophysiologically mapped at various intervals after surgical removal of the nasal half of the retina and pigment epithelium. The remaining projection was initially restricted to the appropriate rostral half of the tectum, even if the nerve was crushed and allowed to regenerate. But later, after 137 days or more, it showed a progressive expansion onto the foreign caudal half of the tectum. The magnification factor, the number of micrometers of tectum per degree in the visual field, doubled in the rostro-caudal but not in the medio-lateral direction. Analysis of the sequence of the expansion showed that a few fibers originally projecting nearest the denervated area were the first to spread over it. Then, progressively more fibers moved caudally until a nearly uniform representation of the half retina was established on the tectum. Radioautography also demonstrated that retinal fiber terminals had invaded the caudal tectum. The retinae of these fish were also examined histologically. The density of ganglion cells had not increased, but they consistently showed the axonal reaction. This was not found to be associated with any initial surgical trauma, but rather with the movement of their fiber terminals within the tectum. Frozen sections, through half retinal and normal eyes, were cut and photographed for comparison of ocular geometry. Operated eyes were normal except for a slight but consistent loss of ocular volume. Analysis of the optical geometry showed that recording with fish in air produced two effects: Myopia (10Â° blur circle, or less) and enlargement of the visual field by 15\% to 20\%.},

	abstract = {Although widely accepted, the theory, that neurones carry immutable cytochemical markers which specify their synaptic connections, is not consistent with plastic reorganizations. Half retinal fish were therefore tested for changed markers following expansion. Optic nerve crush at the time of the half retinal ablation resulted in regeneration of a normal, restricted projection; but nerve crush following expansion (many months later) resulted in reestablishment of the expanded projection, assessed both by electrophysiological mapping and by radioautography. Since this implied changed markers, the half retina and tectum were tested independently using the ipsilateral tectum and eye as controls. In normal fish, removal of one tectum and deflection of the corresponding optic tract toward the remaining tectum resulted in regeneration of a positionally normal but ipsilateral map. In experimental fish, after the half retina had expanded its projection to the contralateral tectum, its optic tract was deflected to the control tectum. After 40 days it had regenerated a normal, restricted map indicating that the retinal markers had not changed. Such restricted projections did not expand in the presence of the normal projection even after a year or more. Similarly, the optic tract from the normal eye was deflected to cause innervation of the tectum containing the expanded half retinal projection. After 40 days, the projection regenerated from the normal eye was similar to the expanded half retinal projection. Areas of the normal retina corresponding to the missing areas of the half retina were not represented. Tectal markers had been altered by the half retinal fibers. In a final group, tecta were denervated and tested at various intervals by innervation from ipsilateral half retinal eyes. After five months of denervation, the regenerating fibers were no longer restricted to the rostral tectum but formed an expanded projection initially. Apparently tectal markers are induced by the retinal fibers, changed during expansion, and disappear during long-term denervation.},

	volume = {84},
	abstract = {In 58 adult newts (Triturus viridescens) the eyeball was rotated 180 degrees and the optic nerve was severed in different ways designed to favor random reassortment of the regenerating fibers. Recovery of reactions to visual stimuli occurred within 28 to 95 days. Reversal of vision conforming to the rotated position of the retina was clearly manifest in all cases, as indicated by deliberate reversed reactions, erroneous spatial localization, and other abnormalities of visuomotor coordination directly correlated with rotation of the retinal field. Thus the original functional values of various retinal loci were systematically restored when the fibers had reestablished connections with the visual centers. The reversed reactions persisted without modification by experience despite the decidedly maladaptive character. 
These results indicate that the original functional properties of various retinal points are reestablished without aid of functional adaptation by the growth process itself, and furthermore that the optic fibers from different retinal loci are distinguished from each other in the centers according to location of their ganglion cell bodies in the retinal field, probably through differential physico-chemical properties induced in them by differentiation of the optic cup in development. The effect of this optic fiber specificity in determining orderly functional relations in the centers can be accounted for either on the basis of the Resonance Principle or alternatively in accordance with the author's hypothesis of peripheral induction of central connection specificity.},

	abstract = {Recent evidence suggests that Eph receptor tyrosine kinases and their ligands provide positional information in the developing visual system. We previously found that the Eph receptor Cek5 is more highly expressed in the ventral than dorsal chicken embryonic retina. We now report the identification of a chicken ligand for Cek5 (cCek5-L) that is 75\% identical to the ligand LERK2. In-situ hybridization experiments do not reveal a dorsoventral gradient of cCek5-L transcripts in the optic tectum at Embryonic Day 8, suggesting that this ligand is not involved in guiding Cek5-expressing axons in the tectum. Surprisingly, it is in the retina that high levels of cCek5-L mRNA are present. In the early retina, cCek5-L is more highly expressed in the dorsal than the ventral aspect. Similarly, a Cek5 Ig chimera labels dorsal but not ventral retina, indicating that even if several Cek5 ligands are present, their overall distribution is complementary to that of Cek5. Hence, Cek5 and cCek5-L may both contribute to define anatomical compartments within the early retina. In contrast, in the 11-day embryonic retina the distributions of Cek5 and its ligand(s) show considerable overlap, suggesting changing functions as development progresses. In dissociated cultures of dorsal or ventral retinal cells seeded on plates coated with either receptor or ligand Ig chimeras, the interaction between Cek5 and its ligand(s) or cCek5-L and its receptor(s) is sufficient to mediate cell adhesion and allows neurite outgrowth.},
