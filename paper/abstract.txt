Modelling the Retinotectal projection - does competition stop axons?

In the classic Chemospecificity theory, the retinotectal axon
projection is thought to use pairs of orthogonal signalling gradients
in the retina to specify the eventual location of synapses made on the
surface of the tectum. Similar orthogonal gradients in the tectum
provide a coordinate system which allows the axons to match their
prespecified destination with an actual location on the
tectum. Although the Ephrins have been shown to provide the guidance
which sends axons towards their destination, no mechanism has yet been
discovered which actually halts the axonal growth cones in the correct
location. In this work, we seek to demonstrate that the competition
mechanism which we have shown is sufficient to form the murine barrel
pattern is also a candidate mechanism for the arrangement for the
more continuous retinotectal system.

In a gradient following model, opposing signalling gradients and
competition are sufficient to reproduce retinotectal organisation in
wildtype and experimentally manipulated systems.

We find no need in such a model for axon-axon interactions. We
predict the form of tectal gradients based on the attractive or
repulsive nature of the interaction.

In a gradient followng model of the retinotectal system, local
interactions can account for wildtype behaviour and experimental
manipulations
