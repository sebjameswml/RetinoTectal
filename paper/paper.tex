\emph{In the classic Chemoaffinity theory, the retinotectal axon projection is
thought to use pairs of orthogonal signalling gradients in the retina to
specify the eventual location of synapses made on the surface of the
tectum/superior colliculus. Similar orthogonal gradients in the tectum provide
a coordinate system which allows the axons to match their prespecified
destination with the correct location. Although the Ephrins have been shown to
guide axons toward their destination, there has yet to emerge a complete
account of the local interactions which halt the axonal growth cones in the
correct locations to recreate the topography of the retinal cells. The model
of Simpson & Goodhill (2011) provides an account of the basic topographic
arrangement of cells on the tectum, as well as reproducing well known surgical
and genetic manipulation experiments. However, it suffers from the absence of
a local chemotactic guidance mechanism. Instead, each agent in their model is
given instantaneous knowledge of the vector that would move it toward its pre
specified destination. In addition to the globally supervised chemoaffinity
term, Simpson & Goodhill introduced a competitive interaction for space
between growth cone agents and a receptor-ligand axon-axon interaction in
order to account for the full set of experimental manipulations. Here, we
propose the replacement of the chemoaffinity term with a gradient following
model consisting of axonal growth cone agents which carry receptor molecule
expression determined by their soma's location of origin on the retina. Growth
cones move on the simulated tectum guided by two pairs of opposing, orthogonal
signalling molecules representing the Ephrin ligands. We show that with only
the chemoaffinity term and a receptor-ligand based axon-axon interaction term
(meaning that all growth cone interactions are by receptor-ligand signalling),
a full range of experimental manipulations to the retinotectal system can be
reproduced. Furthermore, we show that the observation that competition is not
and essential requirement for axons to find their way (Gosse et al., 2008) is
also accounted for by the model, due to the opposing influences of signalling
gradient pairs. Finally, we demonstrate that, assuming exponentially varying
receptor expression in the retina, ligand expression should either be
exponential if the receptor-ligand signal induces repulsion (i.e. gradient
descent) or logarithmic if the signal induces attraction (gradient
ascent). Thus, we find that a model analogous to the one we presented in James
et al (2020) that accounts for murine barrel patterning is also a candidate
mechanism for the arrangement of the more continuous retinotectal system.}

\section{Introduction}

The retinotectal projection has proved to be a deep mine of information for
the study of how the cells of the central nervous system are accurately
connected together into functional networks. This projection connects the
light-gathering cells in the retina to movement-related cells in the optic
tectum (known as the superior colliculus in mammals). Light sources
originating close to each other in the environment tend to activate retinal
cells situated close together in the eye so that an image of the environment
is formed on the retinal surface. It has been discovered that the topography
of the retina is preserved within brain regions that process this information
such that cells which are adjacent within the retina primarily excite cells
adjacent in the tectum. This indicates that during development there must
exist a mechanism which ensures the correct arrangement of the axons which
leave the retina and connect to cells in the tectum.

One reason for the success of the study of the retinotectal projection is its
capacity to be experimentally manipulated. In some non-mammalian species, both
the retina and the tectum can be partially ablated, or even physically
reorganised in-vivo, after which axons regrow to restore the order and
function of the system for the individual animal. This manipulability was
exploited in influential work by R. W. Sperry and co-workers during the
mid-twentieth century, leading to Sperry's 1963 summary of
the \emph{chemoaffinity theory} \citep{sperry_chemoaffinity_1963} which
proposes the existence of morphogenetic gradients that guide axons to their
destination. The chemoaffinity theory was given robust support by the
discovery of the ephrin ligands and their receptors \citep{cheng_complementary_1995,drescher_vitro_1995}
which have been shown to form into graded expression fields in the
retina \citep{braisted_graded_1997}, tectum \citep{braisted_graded_1997,feldheim_genetic_2000} as well as in other
sensory systems, such as the somatosensory
system \citep{vanderhaeghen_mapping_2000}. The Ephrin ligands have a clear
effect on axonal outgrowth, as shown in in-vitro \citep{cheng_complementary_1995,drescher_vitro_1995,hansen_retinal_2004} and
in-vivo \citep{frisen_ephrin-a5_1998,rodger_transient_2000,mann_topographic_2002,hindges_ephb_2002} studies.

It is tempting to consider the retinotectal projection well understood. With a
comprehensive theory supported by a biochemical mechanism, is there anything
left to understand? That question can be answered by reviewing retinotectal
modelling papers.

Mini-review here, which contrasts some of the modelling papers. The upshot is
that a central problem with models is not how the axons know how to get closer
to their destination, but how they know they have \emph{arrived} at their true
destination. Also make the point that many of the models are phenomenological
in nature and do not elucidate the mechanisms behind the arrangement.

In a recent paper, we proposed a self-organising mechanism, based on
morphogenetic signalling gradients, which can arrange
axons growing from the thalamus to the somatosensory cortex into the well
known murine barrel cortex pattern~\citep{james_modelling_2020}. In
characterising that system, we explored the effect of various types of
noise. We found that the mechanism was robust to noise in the expression of
the signalling molecules over a wide range of amplitudes and length-scales,
and that noise in the interaction parameters, which are obtained by sampling
the signalling molecules in the source tissue (the thalamic barreloid field)
could cause topological defects. The question of noise in axon guidance has
been explored by \citet{goodhill_can_2016}.

\textbf{New introduction:} Simpson and Goodhill presented a model in which the
chemoaffinity mechanism is non-biological. We offer a model in which a
competition mechanism counteracts the drive of axons along the ephrin
gradient. Will we need the axon-axon interaction mechanism based on
non-same-Eph repulsion?

\textbf{Another approach:} We present a model of gradient-following based on graded
interactions between the growth cones of retinal ganglion cell axons and the
tectal surface. We show that a combination of exponentially graded expression
in the retina \citep{reber_relative_2004} and exponentially (for repulsively
interacting receptor ligand pairs) \emph{or} logarithmically (for attractively
interacting receptor/ligands) graded expression on the tectum permits a purely
local model to reproduce the majority of reported phenomena associated with
retinotectal organisation.

There have been many approaches to modelling the organisation of the
retino-tectal projection. Many of these models are wholly or partially
phenomenological.

A model which carefully deals with receptor
binding is given by \citet{naoki_revisiting_2017} \citep[see also][]{mortimer_bayesian_2009}.

Gradient based models: \citet{nakomoto_topographically_1996}

\section{Model}

Our model was inspired by the agent-based model of \cite{simpson_simple_2011}
and, in common with that work, consists of agents representing axonal growth
cones, originating from a square retina and moving upon a square tectum.
%
\citet{simpson_simple_2011} models three contributions to the movement of the growth
cones; chemoaffinity, competition for space and axon-axon interactions. The
first two of these are modelled without reference to a particular mechanism;
each agent is provided with globally-supervised information about its
instantaneous location and its target location, allowing it to move along a
vector towards the target. Competition is implemented as a movement of
constant distance along the vector between two agents if two agents are within
a threshold distance of one another. Interaction is signal-induced repulsion,
which is triggered if two agents are both within the threshold distance of
each other and have compatible EphA receptor expression.

In our model, space-based competition is omitted and chemoaffinity and
axon-axon interactions occur only via signal transmission between receptors
and ligands, which are expressed in graded patterns on both retina and
tectum. Signals induce attractive or repulsive interactions; for chemoaffinity
the interaction is to ascend or descend the gradient of ligand expression on
the tectum; for axon-axon interactions, the strength of short-range repulsion
(or attraction) is governed by the receptor-ligand expression on pairs of axons.

\subsection{Receptor and ligand expression}

Each retinal ganglion cell projects $n=8$ growth cone agents which carry a set
of 4 receptors, $r$, and 4 ligands, $l$, expressed at levels determined by the
cell's location on the retina. The expression levels of the receptors and
ligands vary with respect to the cell's position on the retinal surface. Each
receptor or ligand varies with respect only to one dimension.  Receptor
expression gradients are arranged in orthogonal pairs with the gradient of
$r_0$ being orthogonal to that of $r_1$. $r_2$, whose gradient is opposite to
$r_0$, is orthogonal to $r_3$. Ligands are also arranged in orthogonal pairs,
with $l_0$ opposing $r_0$ (as $r_0$ increases, $l_0$ decreases) and $l_1$
orthogonal to $l_0$ and opposing $r_1$.

Because there is convincing evidence that EphA and EphB receptors are
expressed in exponentially increasing
patterns \citep{reber_relative_2004,feldheim_genetic_2000,brown_topographic_2000,koulakov_stochastic_2004},
we use an exponential form for retinal receptor expressions, in common with
other modelling
studies~\citep{reber_relative_2004,koulakov_stochastic_2004,simpson_simple_2011}.
%
The tectum expresses the same sets of receptors and ligands, also in
orthogonal pairs of gradients. In this work, we did not consider the effect of
reverse signalling from tectal receptors to RGC ligands so we only modelled
tectal ligand expression. Although several studies model tectal ligand
expression with exponential functions \citep{koulakov_stochastic_2004}, the
experimental evidence for ligand expression is more ambiguous (Supp. Fig
X). Correspondingly, we leave open the possibility that ligand expression may
be modelled by exponential, linear or logarithmic functions.

While we do not explicitly name $r_0$, $r_1$,
etc.~as \emph{EphA}, \emph{EphB}, the suggestion is that $r$ includes EphA,
EphB, Ryk \citep{schmitt_wntryk_2006} and
Neogenin \citep{rajagopalan_neogenin_2004} receptors and that $l$ includes the
ephrin-A, ephrin-B, Wnt3 \citep{schmitt_wntryk_2006} and
RGM \citep{monnier_rgm_2002} ligands, each of which has been shown to play a
role in retino-tectal map formation.

Figure~\ref{f:1} shows colour maps of receptor and ligand
expression, in this case tectal ligand expression maps are linear.

receptor expressions follow this form.

\subsection{Signalling}

In this model, the signal transmitted when a ligand binds to a receptor on a
growth cone can lead to one of two effects; the signal may induce an
attraction towards the ligand-expression region or a repulsion away from it.
%
For axon-tectum interactions, we implemented attraction as a climbing of the
tectal ligand expression gradient and repulsion as gradient descent.
%
To determine the strength of the effect we assumed a purely linear receptor
binding model, and set the chemotactic movement vector of the growth cone to
be
%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{G} = \sum_i^N D_i r_i \nabla l_i
\end{equation}
%
where $r_i$ is the receptor expression for ligand-receptor pair $i$,
$\nabla l_i$ is the gradient of the ligand expression and $D_i$ denotes the
direction of the interaction induced when a molecule of $l_i$ binds to
$r_i$. $D_i$ takes the value -1 for a repulsive interaction or 1 for an
attractive interaction.

For axon-axon interactions, attraction causes a movement along a vector,
$\mathbf{x}_{b_0}$, between two axons causing them to move closer together;
repulsion causes the opposite effect. The interaction, $\mathbf{I}$, is given
by
%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{I} = \sum_b \mathbf{x}_{b_0} Q(d_{b0})
\end{equation}
%
where $Q(d_{b0})$ is the signalling strength between two growth cones, given by
%
\begin{equation}
Q(d_{b0}) = \begin{cases}
     \sum_i^N D_i l_i r_i    & d_{b0} < 2r \\
     0 & d_{b0} \geq 2r
     \end{cases}
\end{equation}

%This is where I really want to say ``the only interactions in the model are
%via forward (ligand-activates-receptor) and reverse
%(receptor-activates-ligand) signalling''. Something like:

%Interactions in the model are by receptor-ligand interactions only. Forward
%interactions are those in which the ligand activates the receptor, delivering
%a signal into the receptor-expressing cell. Reverse signals occur when a
%membrane-bound ligand is activated~\citep{wu_role_2019}.
