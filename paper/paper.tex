\emph{In the classic Chemoaffinity theory, the retinotectal axon projection is
thought to use pairs of orthogonal signalling gradients in the retina to
specify the eventual location of synapses made on the surface of the
tectum/superior colliculus. Similar orthogonal gradients in the tectum provide
a coordinate system which allows the axons to match their prespecified
destination with the correct location. Although the Ephrins have been shown to
guide axons toward their destination, there has yet to emerge a complete
account of the local interactions which halt the axonal growth cones in the
correct locations to recreate the topography of the retinal cells. The model
of \citet{simpson_simple_2011} provides an account of the basic topographic
arrangement of cells on the tectum, as well as reproducing well known surgical
and genetic manipulation experiments. However, it suffers from the absence of
a local chemotactic guidance mechanism. Instead, each agent in their model is
given instantaneous knowledge of the vector that would move it toward its pre
specified destination. In addition to the globally supervised chemoaffinity
term, \citet{simpson_simple_2011} introduced a competitive interaction for
space between growth cone agents and a receptor-ligand axon-axon interaction
in order to account for the full set of experimental manipulations. Here, we
propose the replacement of the chemoaffinity term with a gradient following
model consisting of axonal growth cone agents which carry receptor molecule
expression determined by their soma's location of origin on the retina. Growth
cones move on the simulated tectum guided by two pairs of opposing, orthogonal
signalling molecules representing the Ephrin ligands. We show that with only
the chemoaffinity term and a receptor-ligand based axon-axon interaction term
(meaning that all growth cone interactions are by receptor-ligand signalling),
a full range of experimental manipulations to the retinotectal system can be
reproduced. Furthermore, we show that the observation that competition is not
and essential requirement for axons to find their
way \citep{gosse_retinotopic_2008} is also accounted for by the model, due to
the opposing influences of signalling gradient pairs. Finally, we demonstrate
that, assuming exponentially varying receptor expression in the retina, ligand
expression should either be exponential if the receptor-ligand signal induces
repulsion (i.e. gradient descent) or logarithmic if the signal induces
attraction (gradient ascent). Thus, we find that a model analogous to the one
we presented in \citet{james_modelling_2020} that accounts for murine barrel
patterning is also a candidate mechanism for the arrangement of the more
continuous retinotectal system.}

\section{Introduction}

The retinotectal projection has proved to be a deep mine of information for
the study of how the cells of the central nervous system are accurately
connected together into functional networks. This projection connects the
light-gathering cells in the retina to movement-related cells in the optic
tectum (known as the superior colliculus in mammals). Light sources
originating close to each other in the environment tend to activate retinal
cells situated close together in the eye so that an image of the environment
is formed on the retinal surface. It has been discovered that the topography
of the retina is preserved within brain regions that process this information
such that cells which are adjacent within the retina primarily excite cells
adjacent in the tectum. This indicates that during development there must
exist a mechanism which ensures the correct arrangement of the axons which
leave the retina and connect to cells in the tectum.

One reason for the success of the study of the retinotectal projection is its
capacity to be experimentally manipulated. In some non-mammalian species, both
the retina and the tectum can be partially ablated, or even physically
reorganised in-vivo, after which axons regrow to restore the order and
function of the system for the individual animal. This manipulability was
exploited in influential work by R. W. Sperry and co-workers during the
mid-twentieth century, leading to Sperry's 1963 summary of
the \emph{chemoaffinity theory} \citep{sperry_chemoaffinity_1963} which
proposes the existence of morphogenetic gradients that guide axons to their
destination. The chemoaffinity theory was given robust support by the
discovery of the ephrin ligands and their receptors \citep{cheng_complementary_1995,drescher_vitro_1995}
which have been shown to form into graded expression fields in the
retina \citep{braisted_graded_1997}, tectum \citep{braisted_graded_1997,feldheim_genetic_2000} as well as in other
sensory systems, such as the somatosensory
system \citep{vanderhaeghen_mapping_2000}. The Ephrin ligands have a clear
effect on axonal outgrowth, as shown in in-vitro \citep{cheng_complementary_1995,drescher_vitro_1995,hansen_retinal_2004} and
in-vivo \citep{frisen_ephrin-a5_1998,rodger_transient_2000,mann_topographic_2002,hindges_ephb_2002} studies.

It is tempting to consider the retinotectal projection well understood. With a
comprehensive theory supported by a biochemical mechanism, is there anything
left to understand? That question can be answered by reviewing retinotectal
modelling papers.

Mini-review here, which contrasts some of the modelling papers. The upshot is
that a central problem with models is not how the axons know how to get closer
to their destination, but how they know they have \emph{arrived} at their true
destination. Also make the point that many of the models are phenomenological
in nature and do not elucidate the mechanisms behind the arrangement.

In a recent paper, we proposed a self-organising mechanism, based on
morphogenetic signalling gradients, which can arrange
axons growing from the thalamus to the somatosensory cortex into the well
known murine barrel cortex pattern~\citep{james_modelling_2020}. In
characterising that system, we explored the effect of various types of
noise. We found that the mechanism was robust to noise in the expression of
the signalling molecules over a wide range of amplitudes and length-scales,
and that noise in the interaction parameters, which are obtained by sampling
the signalling molecules in the source tissue (the thalamic barreloid field)
could cause topological defects. The question of noise in axon guidance has
been explored by \citet{goodhill_can_2016}.

\textbf{New introduction:} Simpson and Goodhill presented a model in which the
chemoaffinity mechanism is non-biological. We offer a model in which a
competition mechanism counteracts the drive of axons along the ephrin
gradient. Will we need the axon-axon interaction mechanism based on
non-same-Eph repulsion?

\textbf{Another approach:} We present a model of gradient-following based on graded
interactions between the growth cones of retinal ganglion cell axons and the
tectal surface. We show that a combination of exponentially graded expression
in the retina \citep{reber_relative_2004} and exponentially (for repulsively
interacting receptor ligand pairs) \emph{or} logarithmically (for attractively
interacting receptor/ligands) graded expression on the tectum permits a purely
local model to reproduce the majority of reported phenomena associated with
retinotectal organisation.

There have been many approaches to modelling the organisation of the
retinotectal projection. Many of these models are wholly or partially
phenomenological.

A model which carefully deals with receptor
binding is given by \citet{naoki_revisiting_2017} \citep[see also][]{mortimer_bayesian_2009}.

Gradient based models: \citet{nakamoto_topographically_1996}

\section{Model}

Our model was inspired by the agent-based model of \cite{simpson_simple_2011}
and, in common with that work, consists of agents representing axonal growth
cones, originating from a square retina and moving upon a square tectum of
side length 1 in arbitrary units.
%
\citet{simpson_simple_2011} model three contributions to the movement of the growth
cones; chemoaffinity, competition for space and axon-axon interactions. The
first two of these are modelled without reference to a particular mechanism;
each agent is provided with globally-supervised information about its
instantaneous location and its target location, allowing it to move along a
vector towards the target. Competition is implemented as a movement of
constant distance along the vector between two agents if those two agents are
within a threshold distance of one another. Interaction is signal-induced
repulsion, which is triggered if two agents are both within the threshold
distance of each other and have compatible EphA receptor expression.

In our model, space-based competition was omitted and chemoaffinity and
axon-axon interactions were remodelled so that all interactions were via
signal transmission between receptors and ligands, which are expressed in
graded patterns on both retina and tectum. Signals induce attractive or
repulsive interactions; for chemoaffinity the interaction is to ascend or
descend the gradient of ligand expression on the tectum; for axon-axon
interactions, the strength of short-range repulsion (or attraction) is
governed by the receptor-ligand expression on pairs of axons.

\subsection*{Receptor and ligand expression}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./images/expressions_fig.png}
\caption{Simulated retinal and tectal signalling molecule expression. Four
receptor types are expressed, and four corresponding ligand types. Receptors
of type $i$ are activated by ligands of type $i$.
%
\textbf{A} Retinal receptor expression, $r_i$. Four receptors are expressed and
displayed here in two dual-colour maps. $r_0$ and $r_1$ are red and blue;
$r_2$ and $r_3$ are cyan and magenta. $r_0$ increases as an exponential
function of $-x$; $r_1$ increases with an exponential function of $-y$. $r_2$
and $r_3$ have the opposite sense. Retinal receptor expression is modelled
with exponential functions because there is ample evidence to support this
form. $N$: nasal, $T$: temporal, $D$: dorsal, $V$: ventral.
%
\textbf{B} Retinal ligand expression, $l_i$, is expressed in complimentary
gradients \citep{hornberger_modulation_1999}.
%
\textbf{C} Tectal ligand expression $L_i$. Tectal ligand expression is shown in a linear form,
as there is less evidence to determine whether ligand expression is
exponential, linear or logarithmic on the tectum.
$L$: lateral, $M$: medial, $C$: caudal, $R$: rostral.
}
\label{f:ex}
\end{figure}

Each retinal ganglion cell projects $n$ growth cone agents (referred to
as \emph{branches}) which carry a set of 4 receptors, $r_i$, and 4 ligands,
$l_i$, indexed by $i$ and
expressed at levels determined by the cell's location on the retina. The
expression levels of the receptors and ligands vary with respect to the cell's
position on the retinal surface. Each receptor or ligand varies with respect
only to one dimension.  Receptor expression gradients are arranged in
orthogonal pairs with the gradient of $r_0$ being orthogonal to that of
$r_1$. $r_2$, whose gradient is opposite to $r_0$, is orthogonal to
$r_3$. Ligands are also arranged in orthogonal pairs, with $l_0$ opposing
$r_0$ (as $r_0$ increases, $l_0$ decreases) and $l_1$ orthogonal to $l_0$ and
opposing $r_1$.

Because there is convincing evidence that EphA and EphB receptors are
expressed in exponentially increasing
patterns \citep{reber_relative_2004,feldheim_genetic_2000,brown_topographic_2000,koulakov_stochastic_2004},
we use an exponential form for retinal receptor expressions, in common with
other modelling
studies~\citep{reber_relative_2004,koulakov_stochastic_2004,simpson_simple_2011}.
We adopt the same precise form for the retinal receptor expression
as \citet{simpson_simple_2011} which is
\begin{equation}
r_i(x,y) = 1.05 + 0.26 \exp(2.3 x)
\end{equation}

The simulated tectum expresses the same types of receptors and ligands, also
in orthogonal pairs of gradients. In this work, we did not consider the effect
of reverse signalling from tectal receptors to RGC ligands so we only modelled
tectal ligand expression, $L_i$. Although several studies model tectal ligand
expression with exponential functions \citep{koulakov_stochastic_2004}, the
experimental evidence for ligand expression is more ambiguous (Supp. Fig
\textbf{X}). Correspondingly, we leave open the possibility that tectal ligand
expression may be modelled by exponential, linear or logarithmic functions:
\begin{equation} \label{e:tecexp}
L_i^{\text{exp}}(x,y) = 1.05 + 0.26 \exp(2.3 x)
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
L_i^{\text{lin}}(x,y) = 1.31 + 2.33 x;
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
L_i^{\text{log}}(x,y) = 2.32 + 1.29 \log (2.3(x+0.2))
\end{equation}
Each function has approximately the same expression values at $x=0$ and
$x=1$. Opposing functions are obtained by substituting $(1-x)$ for $x$.

While we do not explicitly name $r_0$, $r_1$,
etc.~as \emph{EphA}, \emph{EphB}, the suggestion is that $r$ includes EphA,
EphB, Ryk \citep{schmitt_wntryk_2006} and
Neogenin \citep{rajagopalan_neogenin_2004} receptors and that $l$ and $L$
include the ephrin-A, ephrin-B, Wnt3 \citep{schmitt_wntryk_2006} and
RGM \citep{monnier_rgm_2002} ligands, each of which has been shown to play a
role in retinotectal map formation.

Figure~\ref{f:ex} shows colour maps of receptor and ligand
expression, in this case tectal ligand expression maps are linear. Note that
the expression is discretized, and in simulations, the gradient is computed
numerically from the discretized expression. This makes it straightforward to
perform tectal and retinal `graft' manipulations.

\subsection*{Movement}

At each timestep in a simulation, the position, $\mathbf{x}_{b,t}$, of each
branch, $b$, is updated according to
%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}_{b,t+1} = \mathbf{x}_{b,t} + \mathbf{M}_{b}
\end{equation}
%
where $\mathbf{M}_{b}$, the movement vector, is the sum of a chemoaffinity
effect, $\mathbf{G}_b$, an axon-axon interaction, $\mathbf{I}_b$ and a `border effect',
$\mathbf{B}_b$, which acts to retain branches within the tectal region:
%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{M}_{b} = m_1 \mathbf{G}_b + m_2 \mathbf{I}_b + m_3 \mathbf{B}_b
\end{equation}
%
evaluated at time $t$. $m_1$, $m_2$ and $m_3$ are scalar parameters.

\subsection*{Chemoaffinity}

In this model, the signal transmitted when a ligand binds to a receptor on a
branch (forward signalling) can lead to one of two effects; the signal may
induce an attraction towards the ligand-expressing region or a repulsion away
from it.
%
For axon-tectum interactions, we implemented attraction as a climbing of the
tectal ligand expression gradient and repulsion as gradient descent.
%
To determine the strength of the effect we assumed a purely linear receptor
binding model, and set the chemotactic movement vector of the branch $b$ at
location $\mathbf{x}_b$ on the tectum to be
%
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{G}_b = \sum_i^N F_i\,r_{i,b} \nabla L_i(\mathbf{x}_b)
\end{equation}
%
where $r_{i,b}$ is the receptor expression on branch $b$ for ligand-receptor
pair $i$, $\nabla L_i$ is the gradient of expression of ligand $i$ on the
tectum and $F_i$ denotes the direction of the interaction induced when a
molecule of ligand $i$ binds to a receptor $i$ molecule. $F_i$ takes the value
-1 for a repulsive interaction or 1 for an attractive interaction.

\subsection*{Axon-axon interactions}

For axon-axon interactions, repulsion causes a movement of branch $b$ along a
unit vector, $\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{kb}$, from branch $k$ to branch $b$ causing
them to move further apart; attraction causes the opposite movement. The
interaction, $\mathbf{I}_b$, acting on branch $b$, is given by
%
\begin{equation}
% No \frac{1}{|B_b|} in this one
\mathbf{I}_b = \sum_k \hat{\mathbf{x}}_{kb}\,Q(d_{kb})
\end{equation}
%
where $Q(d_{kb})$ is the signalling strength between two growth cones of
radius $r$ a distance $d_{kb}$ from one another, given by
%
\begin{equation}
Q(d_{kb}) = \begin{cases}
     \sum_i^N F_i\,r_{i,b}\,l_{i,k}    & d_{kb} \leq 2r \\
     0 & d_{kb} > 2r
     \end{cases}
\end{equation}
%
The sign of $Q$ (which is dependent on the values of $F_i$) determines whether
the interaction, $\mathbf{I}_b$, is repulsive or attractive. $l_{i,k}$ is the
expression of ligand $i$ on branch $k$.

\subsection*{Border effect}

We implement a border effect based on gradient following by assuming that
there is some other molecular signal which acts on all branches near the
boundary of the tectal tissue. For a branch with position $(x,y)$, $\mathbf{B}_b$ is
given by:
%
\begin{equation}
B_{b,x} = \begin{cases}
        2r-x    & x<2r \\
        1-2r-x    & x>1-2r
\end{cases}
B_{b,y} = \begin{cases}
        2r-y    & y<2r \\
        1-2r-y    & y>1-2r
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
%
Thus $\mathbf{B}_b$ is equivalent to the action of a repulsive signalling
molecule expressed around the border of the tectum, whose expression increases
quadratically outside the tectum.

\subsection*{Initial conditions}

Branches were randomly distributed in a stripe at the rostral side of the
tectum at the start of each simulation. Each RGC axon was assigned a random
initial position coordinate:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}_{\text{axon},t=0} = (U(0,1), U(-0.2,0))
\end{equation}
where U(p,q) is a number selected from a random uniform distribution in the
range $[p,q)$. Each of the $n$ branches per RGC axon was given its parent
axon's initial position, plus a randomly generated offset with coordinates
derived from a normal distribution of mean 0 and standard deviation 0.1.

\section{Results}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./images/j4_ee_wt.png}
\caption{Gradient following model with axon-axon interaction}
\label{f:wt}
\end{figure}

We first present the result of running the model above, which assumes that
axonal growth cones express graded levels of receptors which interact with
ligands expressed as gradients on the tectum and on the surface of other
growth cones to guide their movement. We make the following additional
assumptions: i) All receptor-ligand interactions are repulsive, as for
EphA-ephrinA coupling \citep{nakamoto_topographically_1996}; and ii) tectal
ligand expressions vary exponentially along a given axis, following
Eq.\,\ref{e:tecexp}.

\subsection*{Chemoaffinity---Wildtype}

Introductory sentence.

We now describe the behaviour of a model which has only the gradient-based
chemoaffinity effect and no axon-axon interaction or border effect
(i.e.~$m_2=m_3=0$). This model was run with $n=8$ branches per RGC axon. All
receptor-ligand signals induced repulsive interactions (i.e.~gradient
descent). Receptor and ligand expressions were as shown in Fig.\,\ref{f:ex},
noting that tectal ligand expression was of exponential form
(Eq.\,\ref{e:tecexp}). Fig.\,\ref{f:ch}A gives a colour map of retinal
ganglion cell soma locations, with the colour red encoding $x$ position on the
temporal-nasal axis (with red signifying nasal positions). Green encodes $y$
position on the dorso-ventral axis.
%
Fig.\,\ref{f:ch}B shows the expected final location of each RGC axon,
according to experimental observations, in a `fishnet' plot which draws lines
between adjacent axons giving a visual indication of the topology of the
arrangement.
%
Fig.\,\ref{f:ch}C shows the position of
400 branches at $t=500$ (in arbitrary time units). Considering each
coordinate axis separately, each branch interacts differentially with two
opposing gradients. Branches which settle nearest the rostral edge of the
tectum interact more strongly with the gradient $L_0$ than with $L_2$
(Fig\,\ref{f:ex}C). A similar pair of gradients separate branches along the
M-L tectal axis. The branches become positioned on a grid due to the
discretization of the tectal ligand gradient (as the number of branches and
tectal elements tends towards infinity, the arangement tends towards a
continuous map---see Fig.\,S1 \textbf{FIXME}).

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{./images/j4_ee_chemoonly_wt_chemoonly.png}
\caption{Chemoaffinity model}
\label{f:ch}
\end{figure}

Fig.\,\ref{f:ch}D shows a fishnet plot of the RGC axon centroids; the mean
location of $n$ branches per axon. Because all $n$ branches for each RGC have
identical receptor expression and they experience only the chemoaffinity
effect, each branch attains almost the same final position and so the centroid
graph strongly resembles Fig.\,\ref{f:ch}B. Fig.\,\ref{f:ch}D indicates that
the topology of the arrangement resembles that of the experimental result, but
the area over which the branches arrange themselves is limited to about 50\%
of the tectum. It is possible to tailor the tectal ligand expression, whcih
adjusts the relative contributions of the opposing interactions, to tune the
final map. This allows the chemoaffinity model to attain a good match to the
experimental arrangement (Fig.\~S2 \textbf{fixme}). However, the match is

%% For the noise based paper:
%% Instead, we treat the receptor binding at the growth cone with greater
%% care. Based on a Michaelis-Menten model applied to
%% receptor binding, \citet{mortimer_bayesian_2009} give an expression for the
%% probability of an individual receptor being bound as a function of the ligand
%% expression, $\gamma$, and the ligand gradient, $\mu$;
%% \begin{equation}
%% P(b=1|\gamma,\mu) = \frac{\gamma(1 + \mu r)}{1 + \gamma(1 + \mu r)},
%% \end{equation}
%% where $r$ is the distance of the receptor from the centre of a 1D growth
%% cone. To determine the growth cone's estimate of the gradient, we assume
%% evenly spaced receptors and sample from a uniform distribution for each
%% location across the growth cone. Activated receptors contribute
