I'll collect the data from the literature that I can analyse with
Stalefish (or literature that already quantified the expression
profile)

So, we have:

Braisted 1997: Figure 4; Ephrin-B1 analysed with Stalefish.
               Figure 1: Ephrin-B1 in retina.

Feldheim 2000: Figure 4; Ephrin-A2, Ephrin-A5 analysed with Stalefish.

Schmitt 2006: Wnt-Ryk signalling mediates medial-lateral
              retinotectal topographic mapping
              See Figure 2 i, j, k.
